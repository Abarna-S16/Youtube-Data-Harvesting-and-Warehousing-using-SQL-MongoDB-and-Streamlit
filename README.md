# YouTube API

The YouTube API (Application Programming Interface) provides developers with a set of tools and functionalities to interact with YouTube's platform programmatically. Here are some common uses of the YouTube API:

- Retrieve information about videos, including title, description, views, likes, dislikes, and comments.

- Get details about a specific video or a list of videos

- Accessing Video Data

- Integrate YouTube content into third-party applications, websites, or services.

- Access data about video performance, such as view counts, likes, and shares. Retrieve statistics and analytics for a particular channel



## MongoDB and MySQL Database
- MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based, fully managed database service provided by MongoDB, Inc. It allows users to deploy, manage, and scale MongoDB databases with ease, without the need to handle the complexities of infrastructure management. We connect MongoDB Atlas to our project to store data in JSON format.

- MySQL on the other hand is a relational database which follows a schema and stores the data in a structured table format. We use MySQL Workbench which is managed by local server for this project

## Data Analysis and Visualization
- Using SQL Queries , the uploaded data from different channels can be analysed to get insights .
- The insights can be shared as tables and charts for better understanding
- We use Pandas, Plotly for this process in the project
